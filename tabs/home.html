		Not IÃ±igo Montoya. You didn't kill my father. Don't prepare to die. My name's Max Azarcon. I'm a freelance web designer who's been dabbling in the arts since late 2010. Over the course of the last few years, I've picked up a few tricks and ideas for design that I like to think make my style a little more me.

		I live in Raleigh, North Carolina. I've been here since October of 2014, and I love it. The weather is awesome, the plantlife is beautiful, and the main reason I moved here is to be with the most wonderful girl I've ever met.

		My free time is spent building websites, playing video games, or laughing at silly posts and comments on <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>. I thrive on learning as much as I can about the world of design, and run on a strict diet of coffee and ramen. Pizza's fine, too.
