		The sites I've built have hours of hard work and dedication put into them. Every time I build a new site, I learn a lot from the experience. This site is the product of all the things I've learned, from the basics in HTML to using various scripting languages. I want to share my experiences here so you can see what kind of progress I've made as a web designer, and hopefully spark a sense of creativity within anyone who sees it.
