		The sites I've built have hours of hard work and dedication put into them. Every time I build a new site, I learn a lot from the experience. This site is the product of all the things I've learned, from the basics in HTML to using various scripting languages. I want to share my experiences here so you can see what kind of progress I've made as a web designer, and hopefully spark a sense of creativity within anyone who sees it.

				Johnson's Jewelers is a jeweler located in Raleigh, NC. The website was fun to build, but the WYSIWYG editor that was created for the theme was a nightmare to use. 10/10 would work on a project like this again, 0/10 would use that theme for anything but for massochistic purposes.

				Another non-profit that I've worked on, Create LA is a team of mentors to help those recovering from addiction and in need of guidance. The responsive, single page website is pleasing to the eye, minimal, and was a pleasure to work on. This site inspired me to look into the science (if you can call it that) behind the one-page appeal.

				CEI was one of the first projects I had the opportunity to work on when I met my current business partner. They're a non-profit that's focused on helping under-privileged kids get the education and life skills they need to make it in the world. Most of what I helped with was aesthetic; placing and styling buttons, managing the size of various elements, making sure color schemes are consistent, etc.

				Bold 47 is the brand of Tony Cottengim, a good friend of mine. He was a freelance photographer, and one of the best guys I know for the job. Some of his best works (in my opinion) are featured on the website. I used a few little jQuery tricks I learned to build the site, and feel like it came out pretty well. Unfortunately, Tony is no longer doing the photography thing, but at least we've got his website to remind us of what he did.

				Imgur Extender is a project by <a href="http://imgur.com/user/ZacMuerte" target="_blank">@ZacMuerte</a> and (me) <a href="http://imgur.com/user/SoulExpression" target="_blank">@SoulExpression</a>, developed to change the loading icon and highlight the admins on <a href="http://imgur.com/" target="_blank">Imgur</a>.

				Trinity's Edge Web Design is a brand of freelance web design that I decided to start a while back. The website is unfinished, but once it's done I intend to use it as a portal for new and returning clients to request projects through. I've got the contact form up, but I'm still looking for images to use on the site. I'm also terrible at content writing for myself, so there's not much there as far as description of service.

				MakeshiftCake was the first website I ever made. I built it for a Minecraft server I ran when it was still in early beta. It's not a particularly good site, but it's something I made for a small community I managed. The site is broken right now, but I'm still trying to restore it to what it used to be.
